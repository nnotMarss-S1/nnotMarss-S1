Unknown:
hey, have you seen mars around? i haven’t heard from them in a while.

Juno:
ah, mars... well, they’re somewhere, just not here. the winds are silent for now.

Unknown:
what do you mean? are they okay?

Juno:
they’re gathering strength. sometimes, even the brightest stars must fade to shine again.

Unknown:
so, they’re gone? for good?

Juno:
not gone, just... waiting. the world will bloom again in spring. that’s when they’ll return.

Unknown:
spring? that’s a long time. why that?

Juno:
seasons change, and so do we. mars will return when the flowers awake. just trust the rhythm of time.

Unknown:
i guess we’ll just have to wait, huh?

Juno:
patience, dear one. the fennec’s paws will return when the world is ready to dance again. until then, listen for the whispers of spring.

Unknown:
alright... i’ll wait. i just hope they’re okay.

Juno:
they are. in the silence, there’s strength. and when the flowers bloom, they’ll be back.
