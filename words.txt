- Ladybug:
Some of you may know me, some not, since May 2024 Ladybug has been a very big part of my life, I still recall the feeling I had when first joining Ladybug as a customer, then JSE, all the way to Management, and finally Development. It's been an amazing journey, I've met many wonderful people, all of current Ownership; Albus, Caroline and Florek from Head Office; Everyone in current Development and Human Resources Departments; Alex, Timmy and Nvkxt from Public Relations; and last but not least: Monika and Tobi from Management. If not for you, I probably wouldn't last this long, but times change, and so do we. I really don't want to to this, but because of my mental health, I don't think I'm an appropriate person for my job. But still, thank you for everything you did.

- Dino:
My time was short there, but I'm still glad I was able to be the Chief Development Officer, it's really an important job, and I wish all the best for everyone at Dino, but I'm unable to commit to my role as of now. I hope that upcoming V2 will bring in more players, good luck Presidential Team, thank you.

- Solaris:
At this moment, I resign as the Solar Direction Vanguard, appointing the new SDV, bready313, from the bottom of my heart, I wish all the best for you, and the future of Solaris, good luck in this journey. If not in Tech industry, then anything else you have in mind, I'm more than excited to see what he has in mind. Thank you.

- Boyfriend:
No, I'm not breaking up, but I felt like mentioning it here is a good place, since 9th of December my life has been completely different, you managed to somehow fix my heart, even though you found me in my most broken state. Words can't express my love to you, I don't think I'll be ever able to repay you for everything you did, thank you.<3

- End:
I really appreciate every moment I had, I'm gonna be much less active both on Discord and Roblox, I think my focus is going to shift to my love, and real life things, there's a lot to do, a lot to fix, I don't wish to be remembered, I rather be forgotten by everyone. Don't take this open letter as a way to bring attention to my person, I just wanted to finally speak my mind, and rest. This is my final goodbye, and final thank you. Because no words can express my gratitude for everything. See you on the flip side.
