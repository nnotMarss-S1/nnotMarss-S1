i shimmer in the glow of the digital light,
a fennec's voice in the starry night.
yet the constellations must fade away,
to gather strength for another day.
though my paws may leave no trail to find,
know i'm watching, always entwined.
so search not for the fox's den,
i'll return, though i know not when.
